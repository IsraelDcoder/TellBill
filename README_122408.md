TellBill – How to Run This App

This README explains exactly how to set up and run TellBill locally.

If you follow the steps in order, the app will run.


---

Project Structure

TellBill has two parts:

Backend – Node.js + Express

Mobile App – React Native (Expo)


Both must be running.


---

Requirements

Install these first:

Node.js (v18+)

npm

Git

PostgreSQL

Expo Go app (on your phone)



---

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <REPO_URL>
cd tellbill


---

2. Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root folder:

cp .env.example .env

Fill in the required values inside .env.

> All required keys are documented in .env.example.

3. Install Dependencies

npm install


---

4. Database Setup

Make sure PostgreSQL is running.

Create a database:

CREATE DATABASE tellbill;

Run migrations:

npm run db:push


---

5. Start the Backend

npm run server:dev

Backend runs on:

http://localhost:3000


---

6. Start the Mobile App

Open a new terminal:

npm run client:dev

Scan the QR code with Expo Go

Ensure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi

Backend URL in .env must use your local IP, not localhost


Example:

EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.1.20:3000

7. Confirm It Works

Inside the app, you should be able to:

Sign up / log in

Record voice → generate invoice

Create invoices

Use scope of proof & approvals


If these work, setup is complete.
